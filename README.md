# [IoTFW.js - Practical Internet of Things with Javascript]

The book "Practical Internet of Things with Javascript by Arvind Ravulavaru" consists of three main parts:
* IoTFW.js (server)

This is the implementation of the IoTFW.js based on that book.
The book uses node.js to implement the server, and we followed all the steps according the book.
